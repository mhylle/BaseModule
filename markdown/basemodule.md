# Basemodule

The function of the basemodule is to provide examples of the best practices when doing Angular code.

If you have suggestions on improvements/additions that should be added to the project, please contact me at
mhylle@yahoo.com.

I hope this module helps you in your quest to create even better Angular code :)
