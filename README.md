# BaseModule

This is an angular project aimed at demonstrating some of the basic methodologies used in Angular.
A branch of this project 'ngrx' exists to demonstrate how to implement the redux pattern in the project.

Be aware that as this is a demo project, some essentials such as testing has not been implemented.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.14.

## Development server
Run `npm run json-server` to start the backend server. The server contained 3 endpoints: `http://localhost:3000/diagnoses`, `http://localhost:3000/patients`, `http://localhost:3000/address`.
 
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
